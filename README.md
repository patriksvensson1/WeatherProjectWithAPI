This is a personal Python project that retrieves weather forecasts using the 'geopy' library in combination with Open-Meteo's Free Open Source Weather API.

I originally created a web scraper but given that it sometimes seems to be a legal grey zone i opted to do an API version instead.


The 'geopy' library facilitates the conversion of location names into longitude/latitude coordinates, which are then utilized with the Open-Meteo API to retrieve weather forecasts.
You can enter locations multiple times to create a .csv file with multiple columns of forecast data
